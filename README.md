# ARMAssembly

Task 1
a) Write an ARM assembly program to implement the Breadth First Search Algorithm for a sorting operation in ascending order over a binary tree having the following 15 values: (10, 5, 30, 78, 2, 19, 11, 23, 48, 79, 1, 14, 9, 41, 31)

Task 2 
a) Write an ARM assembly for Merge Sort Algorithm. for a sorting operation in ascending order over an integer ARRAY having the following ten values: (8, 29, 50, 81, 4, 23, 24, 30, 1, 7)
